Because of copyright law, you cannot use everything you find on the web. Below you will learn how to find images with the right permissions, which you can use in your digital making without breaking copyright laws.

### Understanding copyright law

Copyright law is designed to protect creators of artistic, literary, musical, and dramatic works from having their work exploited or misused. This means that copyright law applies to all manner of materials offline and online, including images and art work.

Anyone who uses a copyrighted work without the owners' permission is guilty of copyright infringement. This is sometimes true even if the work has been changed significantly.

Many images on the internet are protected by copyright. The copyright symbol Â© does not have to be present in the image for copyright to exist.

If you want to use an image for which you require permission, you will need to obtain permission from all the copyright owners. Otherwise, you can search for images that are free for you to use through Creative Commons licensing.

### Creative Commons

Creative Commons licensing allows the creator of an image to select which permissions they want to give to people to their work for free. With Creative Commons licensing you can give away all rights to your work, or just some of them. The [Creative Commons site](https://creativecommons.org/){:target="_blank"} has an online form that helps you to configure exactly which of your rights you want to give away.

Having Creative Commons licensing makes it easier for people to find images that they have permission to use. On the Creative Commons website, there is a [search tool](https://search.creativecommons.org/){:target="_blank"}, which you can use to find images that have a Creative Commons license. Another good place to look for images available under a Creative Commons license is [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page){:target="_blank"}.

Many search engines also feature a way to search for images with a Creative Commons license so that people can avoid breaking copyright law.

### Searching for images with Google

If you are using Google, follow the instructions below to find an image you can use in your digital making:

+ Go to Google Images and type in what you are searching for. Here, we searched for `cat fail`:

+ Click on **Search Tools**, then **Usage Rights**, and select **Labeled for Reuse**.

+ Choose an image.

+ Double-check whether it is free to use. You can use a reverse image search tool like [TinEye](https://www.tineye.com/){:target="_blank"} or [Image Raider](https://www.imageraider.com/){:target="_blank"} to check for any further usage rights. Here, I copied the image link from the Google search, pasted it into TinEye, and pressed **Search**. As I can see, it has been used many times by people all over the internet, so it is likely that it is free to use. If in doubt, you should write to the owner and ask for permission.
